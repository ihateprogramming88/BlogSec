A group of individuals highly interested in all forms of computing. This blog is a space where we share ideas, concepts, objective facts, and discuss challenges when dealing with sometimes simple or technical aspects of computers. This blog will mainly focus on all forms of security, privacy, anonymity, and operational security.

Another key focus of our blog is to deal with common misconceptions, logical fallacies, and misinformation often seen online and correct the discourse surrounding certain points-of-interests in cyber-security. We aim to provide objective, logically coherent, and structured arguments back by empirical evidence on our blog posts.

The blog's content mainly comes from thoughts from myself or conversations had with other geeky-intelligent companions on the internet and in the real world.

We are students of computer science, cyber-security, and other scientific disciplines.
